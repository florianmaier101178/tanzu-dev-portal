Join Josh Rosso as he explores some cool stuff in the Kubernetes space! We'll start the episode out covering what's new in the cloud native space then get into some exploration! In this episode we'll be digging into provisioning storage for our workloads. We'll dig into CSI, which enables us to plugin drivers that can interact with underlying providers.
