Come hang out with Joe as he does a bit of hands on hacking of Kubernetes and related topics. Some of this will be Joe talking about the things he knows. Some of this will be Joe exploring something new with the audience. Come join the fun, ask questions, comment, and participate in the live chat!

This week we are going to explore Antrea. This is an open source CNI implementation that is built on "Open vSwitch" and focus on stability and a lot of visibility tools.  I'm kind of a networking noob so this should be... entertaining!
